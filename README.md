# MoonCityRuby::Topics

Want to check out our upcoming talks? Or maybe you'd like to check out those sources someone mentioned in a previous meetup? This is the place to be! We're still early on, so we may include that date of the meeting you could expect us to give these talks, or we may not. It'll be a surprise for everyone. But if you find something here that's just too awesome to wait for, let us know and we'll see about bumping it up the queue! 

### Disclaimer

We may use this for whiteboarding some ideas that may not make it into a meetup at all. So don't get too confused if you don't remember anyone delving into these topics.

## Usage

All information given here is meant to be open source and free for anyone's benefit. Please do not post any non-public or otherwise proprietary business logic, authentication secrets, or the like anywhere in this repository. We cannot be held responsible for the commit-er's fault in breaching private information.

That being said, let's focus on public libraries, generalized algorithms, design patterns, and other scenarios (theoretical or real-world) that can expand anyone's knowledge, experience, and efficiency with the Ruby programming language. If you have a topic you'd like to offer to the group, open a pull request with the description being a synopsis of your talk, and if a majority vote of the owners feel Moon City Rubyists would benefit from your information, we'll add it in!
